**Plant Tracker Project**
Plant Tracker is a web app where you can store your plants with descriptions, names, photos and last time when it was watered. It's meant to help you with keeping your plants healthy. This is backend repo, there is also [plant_tracker_front](https://github.com/non4me21/plant_tracker_front) with frontend.

[**Live Demo**](https://plant-tracker-front.vercel.app)
Sometimes server error might be thrown. Please wait couple of seconds, backend service needs to start from sleeping mode. After few seconds everything will be working fine.

**Warning**
It's not production ready. In /settings/demo.py DEBUG is set to True, otherwise static files wouldn't be served. In future Cloudinary will be used for storing static and media files.
